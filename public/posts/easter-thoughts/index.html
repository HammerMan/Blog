<p>As is always the case during the holidays, I reflect on my familial relationships. My parents and I have a strained, but strong relationship.
Nowadays they are barely a part of my larger plans, but this is a fairly new development. In the past we were extremely entwined, to a point most might think was unhealthy. I used to live with family, and would assist in a lot of tasks, and well as be there emotionally and mentally. I would think about ways I could support them while still having time for myself and my interests. I put a lot of value on proving this support, and would often place the needs of my parents over my own. In fact, it was expected of me to do that while I was living with them.</p>
<p>For most of my 20&rsquo;s, this relationship fell into a sort of equilibrium. After college I was only able to find part-time jobs that payed very little. I relied on my family for room and board, and would do my best to support them while I was not working. Instead of spending time getting to know my self and my needs, I instead focused on how best to survive while proving support and care to parents and other aging family members.</p>
<p>In time I got a lucky break, and found a full time job that not only paid well, but was valued by the family. I continued to provide as much support as I could to the family, buy as you can imagine this was extremely difficult as the time I was not working I was expected to be helping disproportionately. Worse still, when I tried to make my living conditional more contractual ie paying to live with them, they refused. It was clear that they knew any material payment would not be equivalent to the labor I was providing to them. So, I moved out on my own, something in retrospect I should have done a long time ago.</p>
<p>It was been two years now since I moved out, and in that time I have worked on creating a reasonable, healthy, enforceable boundary between me and my parents. Unfortunately this has proven to be much more difficult than you might expect. My parents have always had a hard time with boundaries, and it was something I have had to learn about as an adult. When an opportunity arises to test this new boundary they do, and I have to find a way to reinforce it without all of the tools at hand to do so. In time this will improve, and I am hopeful that my relationship with my parents remains strong and becomes more comfortable.</p>
